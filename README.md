# Covid-Vaccine-Distribution 

-Language used: Python

-Estimated the cost of shipping of Covid-19 vaccines from hospitals to towns. 

-Assumed the demand/cases at each townâ€™s centroid followed a triangle distribution - which is parametrized by min, max, and mode. 

-Utilized the minimum cost model using python library- pyomo. 

-Combined the solution for the Minimum Cost Flow Problem with a Monte Carlo simulation in order to come up with good estimates.
